Here's a strange issue I ran into with Laravel 5.1. I had a service provider that was working just fine--registered in
app.php, showing up in services.json and in the Composer autoload files. I installed a new package with Composer and
wrote a little code to use that package in a model. I made a change to some data in the database (just text that would
show on the screen). When I refreshed my page, I got a 404. The routes were not being found. On investigation, I found
that the service provider was no longer being called, neither it's register nor it's boot function.

I searched a bit and found a discussion of a similar problem under Laravel 4.0 and 4.1
(https://github.com/laravel/framework/issues/2760). This suggested running Artisan clear-compiled or manually deleting
the services.json file (/bootstrap/cache/services.json). One solution was rearranging the order of providers in
config/app.php, which also should cause Laravel to recreate services.json.

I tried every "clear" command in Artisan: clear-compiled, cache:clear, config:clear, route:clear and view:clear. This
may seem a little desperate, but I wanted to eliminate all easy solutions since the issue above didn't end up with a
solid explanation or reproducible scenario.
